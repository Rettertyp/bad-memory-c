# Bad Memory Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the "Bad Memory Algorithm", an algorithm by Tim Posielek. It is designed to solve the Group Assignment on Intervals problem.

It is part of the bachelor thesis "Implementing and Evaluating the Bad Memory Group Assignment Algorithm and its dynamic Variant" by Marius Kaufmann at RWTH Aachen University i1, supervised by PD Dr. Walter Unger.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed `gcc`.
- You have installed `make`.

## Running the Algorithm

You can run the algorithm in two ways:

1. Run the `run.sh` script:

```sh
./run.sh
```

2. Manually compile and run the program:

```sh
make
./out/main
```
